4. **Updated Syllabus-Based Content:** Our system automatically updates content based on changes or amendments in the syllabus. This ensures that educators always have access to the most current and relevant educational materials and curriculum changes.

5. **Video Creation with Recording and Active Links:** Our video creation tool enables educators to record engaging video lessons directly within the platform.
